# Data Science Notebooks
A number of notebooks showing practical examples of data science


This repository is a work in progress, more notebooks will be added in the future.

## Notebooks

Each of these notebooks has a different focus; here is a list of the notebooks and their main topic.

- Customer Churn: How to predict customer churn, using a telecom dataset; focus on systematical model evaluation.

- Plot.ly: A few examples of interactive charts using the `plotly` library; main focus in on data visualization. Watch it with interactive charts [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asolda/data_science_notebooks/blob/master/plotly.ipynb).

- Seaborn: Another data visualization notebook, after a brief overview of the `seaborn` library there is a practical example on a marathon dataset.

- Time Series: Analysis of time series using `statsmodel` for data exploration (auto-correlation, partial ac, decomposition) and `seaborn` for visualization, using a stock price dataset.
